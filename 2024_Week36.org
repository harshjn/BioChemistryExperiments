** Goal of experiments
The goal is to build GUVs and SUVs which are large in size. 

** Methodology: GUV-F
We aim to make Fluorescent GUVs with DOPS and DOPC, and Liss-Rhod-PE
500mOsm/L of Sucrose buffer is made by adding 17.12 g sucrose to 100 ml water.

Using the protocol previously made on 29 July 2024. 
|---------+---------------+--------|
| Content | Concentration | Volume |
|---------+---------------+--------|
| DOPC    | 2.5 mg/ml     | 800 ul |
| DOPS    | 2.5 mg/ml     | 80  ul |
| Rh-PE   | 0.01 mg/ml    | 50 ul  |
|         |               |        |

Out of this solution, 50ul was deposited on a large ITO (50 mm x 50 mm) and left for drying.
