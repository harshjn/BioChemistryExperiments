** Goal of experiments
The goal is to build GUVs and SUVs which are large in size. 

** Available solutions and their concentrations

Using the protocol previously made on 29 July 2024.

** Methodology: GUV-F
We aim to make Fluorescent GUVs with DOPS and DOPC, and Liss-Rhod-PE
500mOsm/L of Sucrose buffer is made by adding 17.12 g sucrose to 100 ml water.

Using the protocol previously made on 29 July 2024.Also, 0.4 ml of this solution is left, made on 29 July, 2024. More DOPS has been ordered. 
  
|---------+---------------+--------|
| Content | Concentration | Volume |
|---------+---------------+--------|
| DOPC    | 10 mg/ml      | 800 ul |
| DOPS    | 10 mg/ml      | 80  ul |
| Rh-PE   | 0.01 mg/ml    | 50 ul  |
|---------+---------------+--------|
Out of this solution, 100ul was deposited on a large ITO (50 mm x 50 mm) and left for drying overnight.

For the electroformation, 50Hz, 6 Vpp and the distance between plates, ie, height of spacer: 1.2mm to 1.4 mm. 

** Methodology: SUV-F
***  September 4, 2024

Using the protocol previously made on 20 June 2024. 
|-----------+---------------+---------|
| Content   | Concentration | Volume  |
|-----------+---------------+---------|
| DOPC      | 2.5 mg/ml     | 100 ul  |
| DOTAP     | 2.5 mg/ml     | 400  ul |
| NBD-DoTAP | 0.01 mg/ml    | 100 ul  |
|           |               |         |
|-----------+---------------+---------|

So, I end up putting 100 ul of a solution into 6 vials and let them dry. 

***  September 17, 2024, Tuesday 
It turns out that 100 ul is too little and the fluorescent concentrations here are too little as well.
So, it will be better to use the 

**** Sample 1 - SUV-F
55% DOTAP Fluorescent
|-----------+---------------+----------|
| Content   | Concentration | Volume   |
|-----------+---------------+----------|
| DOPC      | 10 mg/ml      | 200 ul   |
| DOTAP     | 2.5 mg/ml     | 1000  ul |
| NBD-DoTAP | 0.01 mg/ml    | 300 ul   |
|-----------+---------------+----------|
The entire contents are left for drying overnight in a vial.


**** Sample 2 - SUV-Ff
38% DOTAP Fluorescent
|-----------+---------------+---------|
| Content   | Concentration | Volume  |
|-----------+---------------+---------|
| DOPC      | 10 mg/ml   | 200 ul |
| DOTAP     | 2.5 mg/ml     | 500  ul |
| NBD-DoTAP | 0.01 mg/ml    | 300 ul |
|           |               |         |
|-----------+---------------+---------|
The entire contents are left for drying overnight in a vial. 



** GUV-F
I will make 50% DOPS-DOPC solution by adding 160 microliters of each to a vial. This can indeed be diluted later on.
