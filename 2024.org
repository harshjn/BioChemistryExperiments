** Methodology: GUV-F
We aim to make Fluorescent GUVs with DOPS and DOPC, and Liss-Rhod-PE
500mOsm/L of Sucrose buffer is made by adding 17.12 g sucrose to 100 ml water.

Using the protocol previously made on 29 July 2024.Also, 0.4 ml of this solution is left, made on 29 July, 2024. More DOPS has been ordered. 
  
|---------+---------------+--------|
| Content | Concentration | Volume |
|---------+---------------+--------|
| DOPC    | 10 mg/ml      | 800 ul |
| DOPS    | 10 mg/ml      | 80  ul |
| Rh-PE   | 0.01 mg/ml    | 50 ul  |
|---------+---------------+--------|
Out of this solution, 100ul was deposited on a large ITO (50 mm x 50 mm) and left for drying overnight.

For the electroformation, 50Hz, 6 Vpp and the distance between plates, ie, height of spacer: 1.2mm to 1.4 mm. 

** Methodology: SUV-F
***  September 4, 2024

Using the protocol previously made on 20 June 2024. 
|-----------+---------------+---------|
| Content   | Concentration | Volume  |
|-----------+---------------+---------|
| DOPC      | 2.5 mg/ml     | 100 ul  |
| DOTAP     | 2.5 mg/ml     | 400  ul |
| NBD-DoTAP | 0.01 mg/ml    | 100 ul  |
|           |               |         |
|-----------+---------------+---------|

So, I end up putting 100 ul of a solution into 6 vials and let them dry. 

***  September 17, 2024, Tuesday 
It turns out that 100 ul is too little and the fluorescent concentrations here are too little as well.
So, it will be better to use the

The entire contents are left for drying overnight in a vial.

The results of the SUV-F characterization can be found in ~/OneDrive/Work2024/Experiments_Sept/Sept23/IISC_DLS_Results.
We find that the vesicles are quite uniform in size at 200 nm, although expected was 100 nm diameter for 100 nm pore size. Moreover, varying the charge didn't really materialise as Sample 1,2 had surface charge of 55% and Sample 3,4 had surface charge of 38% but the potential is measured to be the same in both cases. 
**** TODO Identify a way to measure surface charge using the DLS technique, and quantitatively establish if 10% and 90% charge is measured to be different by preparing 90% and 10% charged vesicles. 


** GUV-F
I will make 50% DOPS-DOPC solution by adding 160 microliters of each to a vial. This can indeed be diluted later on. 

** Protocol-Experiments: October - Viscoelasticity/osmosis
***  September 30, 2024, Monday
In these set of experiments we aim to vary the visco-elasticity of the medium in which vesicles are formed by varying the concentration of methyl-cellulose. At the same time, we are varying the glucose and sucrose concentrations. 

We use the medium of 0.25% methyl cellulose (0.025 g in 10 ml of water) and use it as the buffer for building our vesicles. 
For the vesicle solution we use the DOPC+NBD-DoTAP medium where 80 ul of 2.5 mg/ml solution is used in 20 ul of 0.01 mg/ml fluorescent TAP.


|-----------+---------------+--------+----------|
| Chemical  | concentration | volume | Molarity |
|-----------+---------------+--------+----------|
| DOPC      | 10 mg/ml      | 40 ul  |   99.95% |
| NBD-DoTAP | 0.01mg/ml     | 20 ul  |    0.05% |
|           |               |        |          |

60 ul of this fluid was deposited on a ITO slide and left for drying in vacuum overnight after covering it in foil to prevent photo-bleaching.

We aim to make at least two columns in the same PDMS spacer plate so that we have a slightly higher throughput of at least two samples in one electroformation. 

Next we place 0.125% MC (Methyl Cellulose) with 500mM sucrose and 500mM sucrose in water into Electroformation as follows:

1 hr: 10 Hz 6 Vpp (11.40-12.40)
1 hr: 10 Hz 9 Vpp (12.40-13.40)
1 hr: 50 Hz 9 Vpp (13.40-14.40)

Then we prepare 0.125% MC with 500mM Glucose solution and 500mM Glucose solution in water and try to observe vesicles in both cases. 

We also need two chambers for each of the two samples. 

Observations: We observed that the

Plan is to do multiple experiments in a day and extract out numbers:
1. How does the area expansion change in the presence of osmotic shock
2. How does the area expansion change in the presence of fusion
3.
